# 2017 CyREST Competition
There were four winners of the 2017 CyREST Competition, all demonstrating solved problems using R and Python combined with Cytoscape Automation.

The winners were:
* [Leandro Lima](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape-automation/blob/master/for-scripters/Python/Lima_data_mining_%26_visualization_-_2017_CyREST_Challenge)  (Python)   [teaser](https://www.ime.usp.br/~llima/batb/network.html)
  - Mined skateboarding data and produced simple visualization ... shows data acquisition and basic CyREST usage

* [Mark Grimes](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape-automation/tree/master/for-scripters/R/cyrest-challenge-2017-grimes) (R) [teaser](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape-automation/blob/master/for-scripters/R/cyrest-challenge-2017-grimes/LINCSRNotebook1.Rmd)
  - Shows how derive multiple results from a valuable biological network, to compose visualizations and get them into a standalone browser display
  
* [Matthias KÃ¶nig](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape-automation/tree/master/for-scripters/Python/Konig_SBML_Time_Course_-_2017_CyREST_Challenge) (Python)  [teaser](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape-automation/tree/master/for-scripters/Python/Konig_SBML_Time_Course_-_2017_CyREST_Challenge/README.md)
  - Uses SBML and time course simulation to produce animated pathway (using [cy3sbml](https://github.com/matthiaskoenig/cy3sbml) & [roadrunner](https://github.com/sys-bio/roadrunner))
  
* [Ruth Isserlin](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape-automation/tree/master/for-scripters/R/cyrest-challenge-2017-isserlin) (R) [teaser](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape-automation/blob/master/for-scripters/R/cyrest-challenge-2017-isserlin/Example_ppi_network_pipeline.Rmd)
