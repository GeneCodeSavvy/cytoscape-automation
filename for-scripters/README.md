# Cytoscape Automation for Script Writers
A collection of sample scripts from the 2017 CyREST Challenge is [here](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape-automation/tree/master/for-scripters/challenge-2017).

A curated selection of automation scripts is available [here](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape-automation/wiki).

Scripts can be created in any of a number of forms, including R, Python, HTTP (Javascript, Java, etc) and shell 
files, each with corresponding entrypoints into Cytoscape:
