The Cytoscape response travels the reverse route."

    "Jupyter-Bridge allows a remote Jupyter Notebook to communicate with a workstation-based Cytoscape as if the Notebook were running on the Cytoscape workstation. A Jupyter Notebook passes a Cytoscape call to an independent Jupyter-Bridge server where it’s picked up by the Jupyter-Bridge browser component and is passed to Cytoscape. The Cytoscape response is returned via the opposite flow. As a result, workflows can reside in the cloud, access cloud resources, and yet still leverage Cytoscape features. Jupyter Bridge supports py4cytoscape first, and now RCy3 (R library for communicating with Cytoscape) also support Jupyter-Bridge."
