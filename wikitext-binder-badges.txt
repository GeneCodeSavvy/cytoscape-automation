Launch RStudio online using the Binder badge above. Then follow these steps:
1. In RStudio, go to the *Terminal* tab and run this command to launch Cytoscape:
```
xvfb-run bash ~/cytoscape-unix-3.7.2/cytoscape.sh
```
2. Wait ~15 seconds for Cytoscape to launch. You will see a karaf prompt in the Terminal when complete (ignore messages about OpenCL). You will *not* see the Cytoscape desktop, as it is running in the background. You can see status messages in the Console.
3. Open any of the Rmd files in the working directory of RStudio. Feel free to run or modify any of the provided scripts, but note that your changes will not be saved. *Binder provides only a temporary online space to try out Cytoscape in R.*
